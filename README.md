# Ruffle-Happy-Wheels
Happy Wheels in Ruffle!
(Ruffle is a site that runs flash projects)

INSTRUCTIONS: 

1. Download the happy wheels .swf file from here, or honestly find any .swf file anywhere.
I would recommend finding the .swf file on github but it doesnt matter where you get it.

2. once you have your .swf file go to breme-is-awesome.pages.dev and click on "Select File"

3. Once you see your file explorer choose the .swf file you want to run, and start running the file.

4. Enjoy!
